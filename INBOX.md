- [ ] ➕2026-01-13 add instructions to README.md and website about how to install which is 1) download DMG release that is created b) override mac security warnings (because we have not enrolled in apple dev program and signed this app as yet)

## Someday

- [x] 💤 Create simple titles for each item if a way to do that easily with local tools **✅2026-01-07 ❌ wontfix as no easy way and not that useful imo.**

## Done

- [x] want to have 3 different ways To complete a task **✅2026-01-13 ❌ decided to just complete for now with none of this info needed. See docs/plans/overview-2026-01-07-task-processing.md**
    - processed
    - ignore / trash
    - someday
- [x] Clean mode (unlike journal) where we just create a new note every time yyyy-mm-dd X where X is autoincrementing number e.g. 1 then 2, etc. **✅2026-01-07 already switched to this style.**
- [x] ➕2026-01-06 I want to fix the spacing in the task listing panel (for today) where there's a lot of spaces between tasks. I want them really to be on just one line each task, and I don't want it to if a task is longer than one line, I just want to show the first line of the task and have... on it, and so each of them is nicely stacked, quite compact, maybe almost with a sense of checklist with a checklist symbol maybe on the left-hand end of it. For now, the checklist doesn't even need to do anything, but later on, we can turn it into something, but that would just give you the sense of to-dos. I want it to be relatively, maybe even a little bit smaller font than the main area, and very compact. **✅2026-01-07**
- [x] ➕2026-01-06 **Multiple days** Another thing which is quite a major feature is showing multiple days. Having maybe the stats of the day, and being able to click on a given day would be kind of cool. So, I don't yet know how to do that. I need to actually brainstorm how that feature would go, but I want to be able to see previous days.
  - Take 2: Yes, I want to figure out some way to show previous days beyond today. I need to work out where we put that right now. Let's probably do the simplest thing possible and try and work out what that is. Later on, we can think of something that's really elegant, but for now, let's just find a way to have to see previous days in some way or other. My guess right now for the simplest would be at the bottom of the today panel to put a row with the previous days' little squares, one for each day, colored in if there were to-dos that day. If I click on that day, it shows me that day in the today panel where we currently show the today items. Or we could pop up an entirely new screen. Though I think that's a bit messy.
