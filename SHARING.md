# InboxApp: quick video script

Hey — quick update on InboxApp. The need is simple: when a thought hits, I want it captured in under a second without derailing focus. Not a knowledge base, not a task manager — just a tiny inbox that’s meant to be emptied. That’s the vision.

So the current alpha: it’s a hyper-minimal macOS app. One surface, raw Markdown. Open it and the cursor is already at the end. You just type. It writes to local, human-readable files in `~/.inboxapp`, one per day. There’s a count in the window title like “Inbox — 12” so you feel the pull toward zero. No AI, no tagging, no organizing, no magic. Just capture, fast.

This is very alpha. The UI is intentionally blank, and the “processing” side is basically “move it elsewhere or delete.” But the core capture loop is there: thought → text → out of your head.

If you’re into minimal tools or you want to break your note-app habits, keep an eye on this. I’m experimenting — feedback welcome.
