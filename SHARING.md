# InboxApp: quick video script

Hey — quick update on InboxApp. The need is simple: when a thought hits, I want it captured in under a second without derailing focus. Not a knowledge base, not a task manager — just a tiny inbox that’s meant to be emptied. That’s the vision.

So the current alpha: it’s a hyper-minimal macOS app. One surface, raw Markdown. Open it and the cursor is already at the end. You just type. It writes to local, human-readable files in `~/.inboxapp`, one per day. There’s a count in the window title like “Inbox — 12” so you feel the pull toward zero. No AI, no tagging, no organizing, no magic. Just capture, fast.

This is very alpha. The UI is intentionally blank, and the “processing” side is basically “move it elsewhere or delete.” But the core capture loop is there: thought → text → out of your head.

If you’re into minimal tools or you want to break your note-app habits, keep an eye on this. I’m experimenting — feedback welcome.

# Product Hunt

The need is simple: when a thought hits, I want to capture it in under a second without derailing focus. I've had apple notes, obsidian etc. What i find over time is i get distracted. I switch into the app and see something else. So i wanted it something ultra-minimal that is auto blank the moment i switch to it.

It's not a knowledge base, not a task manager — just a tiny inbox that’s meant to be emptied.

It’s currently a hyper-minimal macOS app. One surface, raw Markdown. Open it and the cursor is already at the end. You just type. It writes to local, human-readable files in `~/.inboxapp`so you can direct access using your own tools if you want - or just use the quick export from the app.

No AI, no tagging, no organizing, no magic. Just capture, fast.
